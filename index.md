# Occultation Timing

*Trying our hands at occultation timing*

## Do we have a shot?

*A back of the envelope signal-to-noise calculation*

* A mag 10 star has flux (at visible wavelengths) of 1,000,000 photons per square meter per second
* The 8" RASA has a collecting area of 0.016 square meters
* We will do 0.1s exposures.
* So we expect 1600 photons in each exposure.
* For a mag 12 star, we only expect 250 photons.
* The full Moon creates a magnitude 18 sky background per square arcsecond at the zenith
* We expect to focus our star to about 10 square arcseconds.
* So the Moon background is 6 magnitudes down per square arcsecond times 10 square arcseconds.
* 10 * 100(-6/5) is 0.04, so the background is only 10 photons.
* Even if we are off by a few factors of 2 for one or another reason, we still have good signal-to-noise.

* TheSkyX may (it's in the right spot, but not cross-referenced to TYC 1881-01156-1) knows this star as UCAC4 575:26069 (provided it has the TheSky Databases module.
* SIMBAD doesn't know it by UCAC4 575:26069, but using identifier UCAC4 575-026069, VizieR knows it.
